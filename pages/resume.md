I found art for and published stories to ProPublica.org and worked with our design director, David Sleight, on the general look and feel of the site. I chipped in on photo and vector illustrations and hired freelance photographers as needed.

I also helped organize ProPublicaâ€™s digital tools and generally handled whatever on the site needed doing. And I happily served as an on-demand copy editor when time permitted.

## Associate producer â€” The Seattle Times

I divide my time between producing seattletimes.com and managing other aspects of digital production. I build centerpieces and teasers, handcraft headlines and summaries and work with editors and section producers on story play. I can handle wire editing and social media as needed.

Iâ€™ve trained several new producers to run the homepage and often help reporters and editors with WordPress, Twitter, Tweetdeck and other digital tools.
