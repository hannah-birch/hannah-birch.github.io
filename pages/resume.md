_December 2019 - present_

Iâ€™m on the digital services team at the MTA, where we work to make [new.mta.info](https://new.mta.info/) and the MYmta apps more rider-centric. Weâ€™re the first in-house team to manage distinct digital products, following a long-established workflow of depending on contractors for this work.

I write, edit, and oversee the creation of content on the MTA site, with a focus on helping our readers get the information theyâ€™re looking for. I work with developers on new features for the site and CMS, and I strategize around content and design with our UX designer and product manager. I also meet with stakeholders across the 74,000-person organization to gather requirements, manage expectations, and deliver exceptional products.

I assembled cross-team, collaborative groups to execute large editorial projects. And I worked with ProPublicaâ€™s platform team to develop and test new features for the site and CMS.

I found visuals for and published stories to ProPublica.org and worked with our design director, David Sleight, on the general look and feel of the site. I chipped in on photo and vector illustrations and hired freelance photographers and illustrators as needed.

I also helped organize ProPublicaâ€™s digital tools and generally handled whatever on the site needed doing. And I happily served as an on-demand copy editor when time permitted.

## Associate Producer â€” The Seattle Times

_August 2012 â€“ August 2014_

I curated headlines and photography on the Seattle Times homepage, choosing photos to feature and handcrafting web headlines and summaries. I worked with editors and section producers on story play, and I designed and produced special layouts for big projects. I also edited wire stories and managed social media accounts as needed.

I trained several new producers to run the homepage and often helped reporters and editors with WordPress, Twitter, Tweetdeck and other digital tools.
