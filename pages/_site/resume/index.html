<h2 id="web-producer--propublica">Web producer — ProPublica</h2>

<p><em>September 2014 – present</em></p>

<p>I find art for and publish stories to ProPublica.org and work with our design director, David Sleight, and our editorial experience designer, Rob Weychert, on the general look and feel of the site. I comb through photos from wire services, work with reps at the AP and Getty from time to time, chip in on photo and vector illustrations and hire freelance photographers as needed.</p>

<p>I also help organize ProPublica’s digital tools and chip in on  whatever on the site needs doing. And I happily serve as an on-demand copy editor when time permits.</p>

<h2 id="associate-producer--the-seattle-times">Associate producer — The Seattle Times</h2>

<p><em>August 2012 – August 2014</em></p>

<p>I divide my time between producing seattletimes.com and managing other aspects of digital production. I build centerpieces and teasers, handcraft headlines and summaries and work with editors and section producers on story play. I can handle wire editing and social media as needed.</p>

<p>I’ve trained several new producers to run the homepage and often help reporters and editors with WordPress, Twitter, Tweetdeck and other digital tools.</p>
