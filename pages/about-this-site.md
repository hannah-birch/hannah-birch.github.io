## How this site is made

I use the static-site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to develop and deploy this site. I hosted this on GitHub Pages for a bit and then moved it over to BlueHost, mostly to figure out how the heck DNS stuff works.

My professional work is almost always in a CMS, so I enjoy the challenge of creating more of the infrastructure. And I get to appreciate how smart my dev/design friends are.

The next thing I want to do here is polish up the header of the site, including reworking the nav.

If you have other feedback about the design or code, or you just want to talk about static-site generators and fun dev tools, feel free to email me at [last name] dot [first name] at gmail.
