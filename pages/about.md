## About me

I’m a content strategist and editor, with rigorous training in journalism and web production. I believe the government should work better for people. Right now I’m the content strategist on a new Digital Services team at the [MTA](https://new.mta.info/) here in New York.

Previously, I worked at [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org), a nonprofit newsroom in New York City that investigates abuses of power. Most recently I was production editor. I managed a team of story producers, oversaw publishing and operations, assembled cross-team groups around big projects, and art-directed major stories. I also worked with ProPublica’s platform team to develop and test new features for the CMS and ProPublica.org.

Before ProPublica, I was an associate news producer at The Seattle Times, where I was part of a team that [won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/seattle-times-staff) in 2015. I curated headlines and photos on [seattletimes.com](http://seattletimes.com/), managed social media as needed and designed special digital projects.

## How this site is made

I use the static-site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to develop and deploy this site. I hosted this on GitHub Pages for a bit and then moved it over to BlueHost, mostly to figure out how the heck DNS stuff works.

My professional work is almost always in a CMS, so I enjoy the challenge of creating more of the infrastructure. And I get to appreciate how smart my dev/design friends are.

The next thing I want to do here is polish up the header of the site, including reworking the nav.

If you have other feedback about the design or code, or you just want to talk about static-site generators and fun dev tools, feel free to email me at [last name] dot [first name] at gmail.
