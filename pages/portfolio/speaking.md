## Mentorship events

I organized ProPublica’s [Diversity Mentorship Program](https://www.propublica.org/article/apply-for-propublica-diversity-mentorship-program-at-ona-2019) for three consecutive years, starting in 2017.

The program is designed to pair people from traditionally underrepresented communities in journalism with hand-picked mentors who can help them succeed. We paid special attention to journalists in the middle of their careers — when it can be especially difficult to find a mentor — who were looking to move to the next level.

I heard very positive feedback from mentors and mentees every year. Many of them are still in touch with each other (and with me!).
