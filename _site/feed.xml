        <title>Photo Edit For Supported Housing Story</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;living-apart-coming-undone&quot;&gt;Living Apart, Coming Undone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181206-supported-housing-lead.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the opening art of a story, showing a man sitting surrounded by his belongings in his apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProPublica reporter Joaquin Sapien spent many months &lt;a href=&quot;https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/&quot;&gt;reporting on a program&lt;/a&gt; aimed at helping people with mental illness in New York live on their own. When he filled us in on the living situations of some of the people supervised by this program, we hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/george_etheredge/?hl=en&quot;&gt;George Etheredge&lt;/a&gt;, a freelance photographer, to document the visual side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot of some of George Etheredge’s photos in the layout.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to keen reporting skills, we loved George’s ability to capture people’s unraveling lives in a way that still felt respectful and humane. I felt a sharp contrast in the photo edit: We had a photo set documenting shocking living situations (a liquifying cantaloupe, a shower left running for the “oxygen,”), but wanted to show them in a way that didn’t make the images feel gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was continually thinking about how to use the evidentiary photographs as a way of holding the system accountable, without compromising the dignity and humanity of the people we photographed. (George’s thoughtful portraits went a long way here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/&quot;&gt;Read the story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We co-published the story with The New York Times and Frontline, and we’re working on a documentary with Frontline slated to debut in early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Electionland 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;covering-access-to-the-vote-in-real-time&quot;&gt;Covering access to the vote in real time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181106-electionland.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Electionland newsroom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/electionland/&quot;&gt;Electionland&lt;/a&gt; is a collaborative ProPublica project that covers voting, nationally and in real time. We partnered with newsrooms across the country, built a database of reliable, vetted tips and identified election administration problems in enough time for them to be addressed on Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181106-electionland-team.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;From left: David Sleight, Jillian Kumagai, me and Setareh Baig, in the Electionland newsroom on Nov. 6. (📸: Mike Tigas)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the main production contact for Electionland 2018, working with the Electionland team, the design and production team and ProPublica editors to make sure training, preparation and day-of logistics went smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNY’s graduate school of journalism graciously let us use their newsroom on Election Day for this project. We tried to anticipate as many needs as we could, from thinking about training and publishing workflows to ethernet dongles and desks. I also hired a freelance photographer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erinlefevre.com/#1&quot;&gt;Erin Lefevre&lt;/a&gt;, to document the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election Day was one of our highest-volume publishing days of the year. We had four design and production team members onsite all day to produce stories, handle art research and help keep the site running well. I don’t often get to produce live, breaking news, so I loved the throwback to my daily-newsroom days. (And yes, there was pizza.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Illustration Commission For Heart Transplant Series</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;heart-failure&quot;&gt;Heart Failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20180516-heart-failure.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the opening art of a story, showing an illustration of a pair of hands stitching a heart with medical instruments nearby&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlie Ornstein at ProPublica and Mike Hixenbaugh at the Houston Chronicle spent 2018 reporting on the heart transplant program at St. Luke’s, a hospital in Houston with a renowned reputation, and why the program’s complications rates were so high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://pepmontserrat.com/&quot;&gt;Pep Montserrat&lt;/a&gt; onboard to illustrate the first few stories, augmenting the art the Houston Chronicle shot and shared with us. We wanted to allude to the systemwide problems in addition to showing people who had been affected by the problems. Illustration helped us do that. We loved Pep’s approach to the subject matter, his mix of literal and figurative heart shapes and the texture he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/series/heart-failure/&quot;&gt;See the series.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this illustration to go with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking&quot;&gt;Julia Angwin story&lt;/a&gt; about Google dropping its ban on personally identifiable web tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took all of about three minutes to put together. Sometimes you have to sweat over ideas for an illustration … and sometimes they just stroll into your head fully formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I showed up with paperwork for my low-vision condition, the DMV was totally baffled.

        <title>Please Stop Calling Me A Guru</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-stop-calling-me-a-guru&quot;&gt;Please stop calling me a guru.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalism has, in my experience, had a difficult time figuring out what to call the people filling the technology centric jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Guru is not a good option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard “news producer.” I’ve heard “homepage producer,” “content editor,” “social media editor,” and “Web editor.” I’ve been called a handful of those, with “Web producer” being the current iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get confused head tips from people who aren’t journalists — and people who are journalists — when they ask what I do. That’s OK. I don’t mind explaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a dangerous trend has emerged among other journalists. I see it happening during formal introductions or meetings, when someone is trying to communicate what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment of grasping for the right word — “producer” doesn’t mean much to people outside the industry — and too often, that word is “guru.”
Every time that happens, I cringe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling me a “guru” is a cop out. The last thing I want to do is give people who don’t understand my job an excuse to continue to do so, and that’s exactly what such a mystical titles does. The word conjures feelings of magic ponies and rainbows without saying anything about my actual skillset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Producer” is not as immediately descriptive as “photo editor” or “art director,” but it still connotes a refined set of responsibilities.
 Production is a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the instinct. “Guru” feels complimentary and edgy, not unlike Google’s ninjas, and it rings of Webby-ness. But it fundamentally fails as a job description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a guru. I have a highly technical job that requires skills that should be described in language that communicates expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reporter” and “editor,” for example, do that. And there is a hierarchy built into how most newsrooms are structured: There are senior reporters, section editors, managing editors, editors in chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chain of command for Web work is less standardized and more malleable. As a producer, I’ve reported to lead news producers, digital managing editors, design directors and even, indirectly, a copy-desk chief-slash-standard editor, whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get it. The organization of the Web world in the context of a newsroom is fairly new, and people don’t always know what to call things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please call me a producer. I swear I will patiently explain my job as often as needed. Because after years of doing this, I’ve realized the only way to make my title more familiar is to use it more often.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Best Of The Northwest</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-of-the-northwest-ceo-pay&quot;&gt;Best of the Northwest, CEO Pay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20140621-best-northwest-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of a story with a sidebar with graphics&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our digital team put together a revamped version of Best of the Northwest, The Seattle Times’ annual ranking of publicly traded Northwest companies. The roundup included a highly sortable chart, put together by a newsroom developer, and an interactive landing page, spearheaded by the same developer and our lead digital producer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I helped design story-level packaging for Best of the Northwest, incorporating nuances from the print design and other parts of the project. I also built out homepage packages for each piece, keeping an eye on traffic and engagement time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20140621-best-northwest-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of a story with a sidebar with graphics&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our yearly look at what local CEOs got paid ran a week after Best of the Northwest. This was less labor intensive for our developer because &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/html/localpages/2023892102_ceo-pay-2014.html&quot;&gt;the accompanying chart&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t as robust. However, it was challenging to make the print design elements translate to the web. I designed and built out &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2023899334_ceopaymainxml.html&quot;&gt;a sidebar&lt;/a&gt; that accompanied each of the nine stories in the section, pulling in the big illustration from print and making sure other important elements were surfaced. And I coordinated with editors on homepage play.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oso Mudslide</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;breaking-news-coveage-oso-mudslide&quot;&gt;Breaking news coveage: Oso mudslide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20140322-mudslide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of a story with a photo of a mudslide&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the only producer in the building on Saturday, March 22, when I saw tweets from a PIO with the sheriff’s office that there was a house in the road after a mudslide near Darrington. I worked with a metro editor to assess the scale of the slide, updating our social media accounts and the homepage as we got information. I realized this was by far the biggest story I’d worked on, at the Times or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two weeks were a blur. The digital team worked long, harried hours keeping the website updated with the work produced by more than 30 reporters and countless editors and managers. We had &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023218573_mudslidewarningsxml.html&quot;&gt;watchdog stories&lt;/a&gt; running within days of the slide. We built a hugely popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/flatpages/local/interactivebeforeandafterthe530mudslide.html&quot;&gt;before-and-after interactive&lt;/a&gt; that was the centerpiece on SeattleTimes.com for the better part of a day. We put together a &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/flatpages/local/victimsoftheosomudslide.html&quot;&gt;page memorializing victims&lt;/a&gt; of the slide. We had too many daily stories and blog posts to count, tracking updates as search efforts continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-one reporters contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023259205_mudslidenarrativexml.html&quot;&gt;narrative of the events that day&lt;/a&gt;, a story with a custom layout I hand coded late one night. We used social media to tell readers what we knew and how to get help. We lowered our paywall on resources for victims of the mudslide. (Read editor Kathy Best’s thoughts on that in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/246699/why-the-seattle-times-lowered-its-paywall-during-the-mudslide-but-didnt-suspend-it/&quot;&gt;this Poynter piece&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exhausting in many ways, but it’s impossible to work on a story like this and not see the significance journalism has. &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/flatpages/local/oso-mudslide-coverage.html&quot;&gt;See all coverage of the Oso mudslide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Education Lab Series</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;education-lab-series&quot;&gt;Education Lab Series&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20140301-edlab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of a story and sidebar with photos and links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education Lab was a yearlong series produced in partnership with the Solutions Journalism Network, with grants from the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.com/html/education/2023026649_edlabadvancedplacementxml.html&quot;&gt;See an example of an Education Lab story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the project, I collaborated with Education Lab’s engagement editor. Together, we strategize how best to present Ed Lab content on the Seattle Times homepage, the education section page and the story level. I designed components on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.seattletimes.com/educationlab/?from=stnv2&quot;&gt;Education Lab blog template&lt;/a&gt; and handcrafted sidebars on the article pages for each big story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with Education Lab content was keeping it organized. We had big Sunday stories, live chats and Google hangouts, blog posts, photo galleries and videos. I loved puzzling out the best place to surface this content, whether as a homepage centerpiece for an enterprise story or as an interactive quiz showing sample GED questions. Communication with editors — and being able to solicit and implement their feedback — was crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
