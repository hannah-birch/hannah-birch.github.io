        <title>How To Bring Your Bike On Public Transit</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-bring-your-bike-with-you-on-nyc-public-transit&quot;&gt;How to bring your bike with you on NYC public transit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common question we get about bikes in New York City is if you can take them on the subway. (Yes, you can, but please avoid rush hour.) As the pandemic stretched on in New York and people lined up to buy bicycles, I redesigned and rewrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.mta.info/guides/bikes&quot;&gt;the bike page on the MTA site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by migrating all of the content from the old page onto our new site. I researched rules and guidelines and interviewed co-workers, then rewrote the page. I also included information about non-MTA cycling resources, like the city Department of Transportation‚Äôs maps and the Citi Bike bike-share program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20200805-mta-bike-page-before-after-composite.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two screenshots side-by-side, showing a web page with large photos and organized text, compared to an outdated-looking page that‚Äôs mostly text.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The new MTA bike page, left, compared to the old one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted photos that illustrated specific guidelines, like where to stand with your bike on a train and how to get through turnstiles. I worked with MTA photographer Marc Hermann and volunteers from the MTA‚Äôs bike-to-work group to art-direct and edit the photos we published on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new bike page got great feedback from cycling and transportation advocates in the city. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jvhawkins/status/1291065197856202753&quot;&gt;This tweet in particular&lt;/a&gt; utterly made my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20200805-mta-bike-page-tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of a tweet reading, ‚ÄòThis is going to sound kind of dumb, but publishing a page that actually promotes bicycling, includes info on non-MTA modes (ferry, CitiBike), and organizes information so clearly and comprehensively would not have happened a decade ago. MTA comms doing great work.‚Äô&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Content Strategy Volunteering For The Covid Tracking Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-strategy-and-editing-for-the-covid-tracking-project&quot;&gt;Content strategy and editing for The COVID Tracking Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had admired The COVID Tracking Project from a distance since March and jumped in in June to help reorganize the site. What had started as a homegrown reporting project had turned into one of the most complete COVID datasets in the country. With the rapid growth came a necessarily ad hoc site structure that the content had outgrown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20200601-ctp-audit-composite.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two screenshots side-by-side, showing two spreadsheets with colored cells. The spreadsheet on the left is longer and the colors are out of order. The spreadsheet on the right is shorter and the colors are in order.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Photo Edit For Supported Housing Story</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;living-apart-coming-undone&quot;&gt;Living Apart, Coming Undone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181206-supported-housing-lead.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the opening art of a story, showing a man sitting surrounded by his belongings in his apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProPublica reporter Joaquin Sapien spent many months &lt;a href=&quot;https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/&quot;&gt;reporting on a program&lt;/a&gt; aimed at helping people with mental illness in New York live on their own. When he filled us in on the living situations of some of the people supervised by this program, we hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/george_etheredge/?hl=en&quot;&gt;George Etheredge&lt;/a&gt;, a freelance photographer, to document the visual side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181206-supported-housing-3-up.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot of some of George Etheredge‚Äôs photos in the layout.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to keen reporting skills, we loved George‚Äôs ability to capture people‚Äôs unraveling lives in a way that still felt respectful and humane. I felt a sharp contrast in the photo edit: We had a photo set documenting shocking living situations (a liquifying cantaloupe, a shower left running for the ‚Äúoxygen,‚Äù), but wanted to show them in a way that didn‚Äôt make the images feel gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was continually thinking about how to use the evidentiary photographs as a way of holding the system accountable, without compromising the dignity and humanity of the people we photographed. (George‚Äôs thoughtful portraits went a long way here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/&quot;&gt;Read the story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We co-published the story with The New York Times and Frontline, and we‚Äôre working on a documentary with Frontline slated to debut in early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Electionland 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;covering-access-to-the-vote-in-real-time&quot;&gt;Covering access to the vote in real time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181106-electionland.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Electionland newsroom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/electionland/&quot;&gt;Electionland&lt;/a&gt; is a collaborative ProPublica project that covers voting, nationally and in real time. We partnered with newsrooms across the country, built a database of reliable, vetted tips and identified election administration problems in enough time for them to be addressed on Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181106-electionland-team.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;From left: David Sleight, Jillian Kumagai, me and Setareh Baig, in the Electionland newsroom on Nov. 6. (üì∏: Mike Tigas)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the main production contact for Electionland 2018, working with the Electionland team, the design and production team and ProPublica editors to make sure training, preparation and day-of logistics went smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUNY‚Äôs graduate school of journalism graciously let us use their newsroom on Election Day for this project. We tried to anticipate as many needs as we could, from thinking about training and publishing workflows to ethernet dongles and desks. I also hired a freelance photographer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erinlefevre.com/#1&quot;&gt;Erin Lefevre&lt;/a&gt;, to document the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election Day was one of our highest-volume publishing days of the year. We had four design and production team members onsite all day to produce stories, handle art research and help keep the site running well. I don‚Äôt often get to produce live, breaking news, so I loved the throwback to my daily-newsroom days. (And yes, there was pizza.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-all-platypuses&quot;&gt;Calling All Platypuses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a post for Source to bring more attention to some community-building I‚Äôve been doing with other people at the intersection of journalism and tech. &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.opennews.org/articles/calling-all-platypuses/&quot;&gt;Read the piece.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Illustration Commission For Heart Transplant Series</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;heart-failure&quot;&gt;Heart Failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20180516-heart-failure.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the opening art of a story, showing an illustration of a pair of hands stitching a heart with medical instruments nearby&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlie Ornstein at ProPublica and Mike Hixenbaugh at the Houston Chronicle spent 2018 reporting on the heart transplant program at St. Luke‚Äôs, a hospital in Houston with a renowned reputation, and why the program‚Äôs complications rates were so high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://pepmontserrat.com/&quot;&gt;Pep Montserrat&lt;/a&gt; onboard to illustrate the first few stories, augmenting the art the Houston Chronicle shot and shared with us. We wanted to allude to the systemwide problems in addition to showing people who had been affected by the problems. Illustration helped us do that. We loved Pep‚Äôs approach to the subject matter, his mix of literal and figurative heart shapes and the texture he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this illustration to go with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking&quot;&gt;Julia Angwin story&lt;/a&gt; about Google dropping its ban on personally identifiable web tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took all of about three minutes to put together. Sometimes you have to sweat over ideas for an illustration ‚Ä¶ and sometimes they just stroll into your head fully formed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Please Stop Calling Me A Guru</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-stop-calling-me-a-guru&quot;&gt;Please stop calling me a guru.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalism has, in my experience, had a difficult time figuring out what to call the people filling the technology centric jobs that didn‚Äôt exist a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Guru is not a good option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúnews producer.‚Äù I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúhomepage producer,‚Äù ‚Äúcontent editor,‚Äù ‚Äúsocial media editor,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeb editor.‚Äù I‚Äôve been called a handful of those, with ‚ÄúWeb producer‚Äù being the current iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get confused head tips from people who aren‚Äôt journalists‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand people who are journalists‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen they ask what I do. That‚Äôs OK. I don‚Äôt mind explaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a dangerous trend has emerged among other journalists. I see it happening during formal introductions or meetings, when someone is trying to communicate what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a moment of grasping for the right word‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äúproducer‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean much to people outside the industry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand too often, that word is ‚Äúguru.‚Äù
Every time that happens, I cringe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling me a ‚Äúguru‚Äù is a cop out. The last thing I want to do is give people who don‚Äôt understand my job an excuse to continue to do so, and that‚Äôs exactly what such a mystical titles does. The word conjures feelings of magic ponies and rainbows without saying anything about my actual skillset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúProducer‚Äù is not as immediately descriptive as ‚Äúphoto editor‚Äù or ‚Äúart director,‚Äù but it still connotes a refined set of responsibilities.
 Production is a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the instinct. ‚ÄúGuru‚Äù feels complimentary and edgy, not unlike Google‚Äôs ninjas, and it rings of Webby-ness. But it fundamentally fails as a job description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a guru. I have a highly technical job that requires skills that should be described in language that communicates expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúReporter‚Äù and ‚Äúeditor,‚Äù for example, do that. And there is a hierarchy built into how most newsrooms are structured: There are senior reporters, section editors, managing editors, editors in chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chain of command for Web work is less standardized and more malleable. As a producer, I‚Äôve reported to lead news producers, digital managing editors, design directors and even, indirectly, a copy-desk chief-slash-standard editor, whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get it. The organization of the Web world in the context of a newsroom is fairly new, and people don‚Äôt always know what to call things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please call me a producer. I swear I will patiently explain my job as often as needed. Because after years of doing this, I‚Äôve realized the only way to make my title more familiar is to use it more often.&lt;/p&gt;
