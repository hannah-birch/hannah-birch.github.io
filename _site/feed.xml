        <title>Photo Edit For Supported Housing Story</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;living-apart-coming-undone&quot;&gt;Living Apart, Coming Undone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20181206-supported-housing-lead.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the opening art of a story, showing a man sitting surrounded by his belongings in his apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProPublica reporter Joaquin Sapien spent many months &lt;a href=&quot;https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/&quot;&gt;reporting on a program&lt;/a&gt; aimed at helping people with mental illness in New York live on their own. When he filled us in on the living situations of some of the people supervised by this program, we hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/george_etheredge/?hl=en&quot;&gt;George Etheredge&lt;/a&gt;, a freelance photographer, to document the visual side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;inset&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot of some of George Etheredge’s photos in the layout.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to keen reporting skills, we loved George’s ability to capture people’s unraveling lives in a way that still felt respectful and humane. I felt a sharp contrast in the photo edit: We had a photo set documenting shocking living situations (a liquifying cantaloupe, a shower left running for the “oxygen,”), but done so in a way that didn’t make the images feel gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was continually thinking about how to use the evidentiary photographs as a way of holding the system accountable, without compromising the dignity and humanity of the people we photographed. (George’s thoughtful portraits went a long way here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/&quot;&gt;Read the story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We co-published the story with The New York Times and Frontline, and we’re working on a documentary with Frontline slated to debut in early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Privacy Illo</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-is-watching-you&quot;&gt;Google is watching you.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/20161021-google-privacy-630x420.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google logo with eyeballs instead of O's&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this illustration to go with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking&quot;&gt;Julia Angwin story&lt;/a&gt; about Google dropping its ban on personally identifiable web tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took all of about three minutes to put together. Sometimes you have to sweat over ideas for an illustration … and sometimes they just stroll into your head fully formed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Story As A Dmv Edge Case</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-story-as-a-dmv-edge-case-how-to-battle-bureaucracy-and-win&quot;&gt;My Story as a DMV Edge Case: How to Battle Bureaucracy and Win&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I showed up with paperwork for my low-vision condition, the DMV was totally baffled. Here’s how I walked them through an edge case and how you can use the strategies yourself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/my-story-as-a-dmv-edge-case-how-to-battle-bureaucracy-and-win&quot;&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Please Stop Calling Me A Guru</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-stop-calling-me-a-guru&quot;&gt;Please stop calling me a guru.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalism has, in my experience, had a difficult time figuring out what to call the people filling the technology centric jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Guru is not a good option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard “news producer.” I’ve heard “homepage producer,” “content editor,” “social media editor,” and “Web editor.” I’ve been called a handful of those, with “Web producer” being the current iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get confused head tips from people who aren’t journalists — and people who are journalists — when they ask what I do. That’s OK. I don’t mind explaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a dangerous trend has emerged among other journalists. I see it happening during formal introductions or meetings, when someone is trying to communicate what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment of grasping for the right word — “producer” doesn’t mean much to people outside the industry — and too often, that word is “guru.”
Every time that happens, I cringe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling me a “guru” is a cop out. The last thing I want to do is give people who don’t understand my job an excuse to continue to do so, and that’s exactly what such a mystical titles does. The word conjures feelings of magic ponies and rainbows without saying anything about my actual skillset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Producer” is not as immediately descriptive as “photo editor” or “art director,” but it still connotes a refined set of responsibilities.
 Production is a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the instinct. “Guru” feels complimentary and edgy, not unlike Google’s ninjas, and it rings of Webby-ness. But it fundamentally fails as a job description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a guru. I have a highly technical job that requires skills that should be described in language that communicates expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reporter” and “editor,” for example, do that. And there is a hierarchy built into how most newsrooms are structured: There are senior reporters, section editors, managing editors, editors in chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chain of command for Web work is less standardized and more malleable. As a producer, I’ve reported to lead news producers, digital managing editors, design directors and even, indirectly, a copy-desk chief-slash-standard editor, whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I get it. The organization of the Web world in the context of a newsroom is fairly new, and people don’t always know what to call things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please call me a producer. I swear I will patiently explain my job as often as needed. Because after years of doing this, I’ve realized the only way to make my title more familiar is to use it more often.&lt;/p&gt;
