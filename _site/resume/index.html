Weâ€™re the first in-house team to manage distinct digital products, following a long-established workflow of depending on contractors for this work.</p>

<p>I assembled cross-team, collaborative groups to execute large editorial projects. And I worked with ProPublicaâ€™s platform team to develop and test new features for the site and CMS.</p>

<p>I also hired and art-directed freelance photographers and illustrators, and I coached story producers on the same.</p>

<p>I also helped organize ProPublicaâ€™s digital tools and generally handled whatever on the site needed doing. And I happily served as an on-demand copy editor when time permitted.</p>

<h2 id="associate-producer--the-seattle-times">Associate Producer â€” The Seattle Times</h2>

<p><em>August 2012 â€“ August 2014</em></p>

<p>I curated headlines and photography on the Seattle Times homepage, choosing photos to feature and handcrafting web headlines and summaries. I worked with editors and section producers on story play, and I designed and produced special layouts for big projects. I also edited wire stories and managed social media accounts as needed.</p>

<p>I trained several new producers to run the homepage and often helped reporters and editors with WordPress, Twitter, Tweetdeck and other digital tools.</p>
