<p><em>December 2019 - present</em></p>

<p>Iâ€™m on the digital services team at the MTA, where we work to make <a href="https://new.mta.info/">new.mta.info</a> and the MYmta apps more rider-centric. Weâ€™re the first in-house team to manage distinct digital products, following a long-established workflow of depending on contractors for this work.</p>

<p>I write, edit, and oversee the creation of content on the MTA site, with a focus on helping our readers get the information theyâ€™re looking for. I work with developers on new features for the site and CMS, and I strategize around content and design with our UX designer and product manager. I also meet with stakeholders across the 74,000-person organization to gather requirements, manage expectations, and deliver exceptional products.</p>

<h2 id="production-editor--propublica">Production Editor â€” ProPublica</h2>

<p>I managed ProPublicaâ€™s story production team and oversaw daily story and newsletter production. I ran the organizationâ€™s editorial calendar, with our managing editor and standards editor, and continually evaluated tools and processes to ensure smooth publishing workflow.</p>

<p>I assembled cross-team, collaborative groups to execute large editorial projects. And I worked with ProPublicaâ€™s platform team to develop and test new features for the site and CMS.</p>

<p>I also hired and art-directed freelance photographers and illustrators, and I coached story producers on the same.</p>

<p>I also helped organize ProPublicaâ€™s digital tools and generally handled whatever on the site needed doing. And I happily served as an on-demand copy editor when time permitted.</p>

<h2 id="associate-producer--the-seattle-times">Associate Producer â€” The Seattle Times</h2>

<p><em>August 2012 â€“ August 2014</em></p>

<p>I curated headlines and photography on the Seattle Times homepage, choosing photos to feature and handcrafting web headlines and summaries. I worked with editors and section producers on story play, and I designed and produced special layouts for big projects. I also edited wire stories and managed social media accounts as needed.</p>

<p>I trained several new producers to run the homepage and often helped reporters and editors with WordPress, Twitter, Tweetdeck and other digital tools.</p>

<p><em>May 2011 â€“ August 2011</em></p>

<p>At Channel Signal, a social-media-monitoring company in Park City, Utah, I sifted through thousands of social-media posts a day and worked with an analyst to extract insight for clients. I created monthly reports for clients in Adobe InDesign, wrote and edited blog posts and researched new digital tools.</p>
