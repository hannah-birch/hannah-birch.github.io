<p>Our digital team put together a revamped version of Best of the Northwest, The Seattle Times’ annual ranking of publicly traded Northwest companies. The roundup included a highly sortable chart, put together by a newsroom developer, and an interactive landing page, spearheaded by the same developer and our lead digital producer.</p>

<p>I helped design story-level packaging for Best of the Northwest, incorporating nuances from the print design and other parts of the project. I also built out homepage packages for each piece, keeping an eye on traffic and engagement time.</p>

<p>Our yearly look at what local CEOs got paid ran a week after Best of the Northwest. This was less labor intensive for our developer because <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localpages/2023892102_ceo-pay-2014.html">the accompanying chart</a> wasn’t as robust. However, it was challenging to make the print design elements translate to the web. I designed and built out <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2023899334_ceopaymainxml.html">a sidebar</a> that accompanied each of the nine stories in the section, pulling in the big illustration from print and making sure other important elements were surfaced. And I coordinated with editors on homepage play.</p>
