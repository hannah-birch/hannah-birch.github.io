  <p>Iâ€™m the deputy editor for production at <a href"https://www.propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, a nonprofit investigative newsroom in New York City. I manage our daily publishing, help execute special projects, lead our team of web producers and work with our design director on the general look and feel of the ProPublica site. I hire freelance photographers and illustrators and coach producers on doing the same. Iâ€™m great at copy editing, writing headlines and herding cats â€” ahem â€” editors.</p>

  <p>Before ProPublica, I was an associate news producer at The Seattle Times, where I was part of a team that <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/seattle-times-staff">won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news</a> in 2015. I curated headlines and photos on <a href="http://seattletimes.com/">seattletimes.com</a>, managed social media as needed and designed special digital projects.</p>

  <p>Find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/hannahsbirch">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hannah-birch">GitHub</a>.</p>
