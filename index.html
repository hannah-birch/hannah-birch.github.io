  <p>Iâ€™m a content strategist and editor, with rigorous training in journalism and web production. I believe the government should work better for people. Right now Iâ€™m the content strategist on a new Digital Services team at the <a href="https://new.mta.info/">MTA</a> here in New York. Ask me how I feel about metadata.</p>

  <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, a nonprofit newsroom in New York City that investigates abuses of power. Most recently I was production editor. I managed a team of story producers, oversaw publishing and operations, assembled cross-team groups around big projects, and art-directed major stories. I also worked with ProPublicaâ€™s platform team to develop and test new features for the CMS and ProPublica.org.</p>

  <p>Before ProPublica, I was an associate news producer at The Seattle Times, where I was part of a team that <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/seattle-times-staff">won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news</a> in 2015. I curated headlines and photos on <a href="http://seattletimes.com/">seattletimes.com</a>, managed social media as needed and designed special digital projects.</p>
