  <p>Iâ€™m the production editor at <a href="https://www.propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, a nonprofit newsroom in New York City that investigates abuses of power. I manage a team of story producers, oversee daily publishing and newsletter production, assemble cross-team groups to execute big editorial projects and commission and art-direct photographers and illustrators. I also work with ProPublicaâ€™s platform team to develop and test new features for the CMS and ProPublica.org.</p>

  <p>Before ProPublica, I was an associate news producer at The Seattle Times, where I was part of a team that <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/seattle-times-staff">won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news</a> in 2015. I curated headlines and photos on <a href="http://seattletimes.com/">seattletimes.com</a>, managed social media as needed and designed special digital projects.</p>
