  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/hannah-birch-headshot.jpg"/>

  <p>I’m the web producer for ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative newsroom in New York City. I publish stories to <a href="https://www.propublica.org">ProPublica.org</a> and work with our design director on the general look and feel of the site. I hire freelance photographers, cruise photo wires, work on photo and vector illustrations and generally chip in on whatever on the site needs doing. I’m great at copy editing, writing headlines and herding cats — ahem — editors.</p>

  <p>In a past life I was an associate news producer at <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com">The Seattle Times</a>, where I crusaded against the forces of bad design and boring Web headlines. I curated headlines and photos on seattletimes.com, managed social media as needed and designed special digital projects.</p>
