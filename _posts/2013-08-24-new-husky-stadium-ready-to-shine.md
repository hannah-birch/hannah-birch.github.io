# New, improved Husky Stadium

I worked with another producer and the Seattle Times graphics and sports desks to [create a custom layout](http://seattletimes.com/html/specialreportspages/2021660818_huskystadium25xml.html) for a special package detailing the newly renovated stadium at the University of Washington.

One of the challenges of this project was coming up with ways to make elements that were designed for print work well online. We used our best judgment to incorporate the elements that worked for us and came up with new digital nuances when we needed them. This included working with graphics editors, art directors and designers to make sure their work translated in the digital space.
