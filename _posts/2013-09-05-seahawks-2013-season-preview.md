## Seahawks 2013 season preview

This was similar to the Husky Stadium project. Another producer and I tag-teamed with the sports desk to take design pieces originally intended for print and translate them effectively to the Web.

Something that stands out for me about this project was a tight deadline. We had essentially a day to put this together, which was daunting. But we felt like rockstars [when we pulled it off](http://seattletimes.com/html/sportspages/2021747297_wilsonprofile08xml.html).
