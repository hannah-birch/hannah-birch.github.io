##  Education Lab Series

Education Lab was a yearlong series produced in partnership with the Solutions Journalism Network, with grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

For the project, I collaborated with Education Lab’s engagement editor. Together, we strategize how best to present Ed Lab content on the Seattle Times homepage, the education section page and the story level. I designed components on the [Education Lab blog template](http://blogs.seattletimes.com/educationlab/?from=stnv2) and handcrafted sidebars on the article pages for each big story.

One of the challenges with Education Lab content was keeping it organized. We had big Sunday stories, live chats and Google hangouts, blog posts, photo galleries and videos. I loved puzzling out the best place to surface this content, whether as a homepage centerpiece for an enterprise story or as an interactive quiz showing sample GED questions. Communication with editors — and being able to solicit and implement their feedback — was crucial.
