## Content strategy and editing for The COVID Tracking Project

I had admired The COVID Tracking Project from a distance since March and jumped in in June to help reorganize the site. What had started as a homegrown reporting project had turned into one of the most complete COVID datasets in the country. With the rapid growth came a necessarily ad hoc site structure that the content had outgrown.
