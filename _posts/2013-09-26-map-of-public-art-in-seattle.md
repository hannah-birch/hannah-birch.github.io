##  State of the art: 10 great pieces of public art in Seattle

I built an interactive map of nearly 400 pieces of public art around Seattle. This was packaged with Seattle Times art critic Michael Upchurch’s [top picks for public artwork in the city](http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainmentpages/2021897726_publicartxml.html), a story that coincided with the 40th anniversary of the city’s 1% for Art program.

After obtaining a spreadsheet from the City of Seattle, I scrubbed the data and used Google Fusion Tables to map where each piece of art is located. I included the title of the piece, the artist’s name and the date it was made. And I designed the story’s layout online.
