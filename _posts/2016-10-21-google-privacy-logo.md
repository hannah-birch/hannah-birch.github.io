I made this illustration to go with a [Julia Angwin story](https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking) about a change Google made to its privacy policy that allows the company to track people as they browse the web.

This took all of about three minutes to put together. Sometimes you have to sweat over ideas for an illustration ... and sometimes they just stroll into your head fully formed.
