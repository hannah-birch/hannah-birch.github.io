## Google is watching you.

I made this illustration to go with a [Julia Angwin story](https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking) about Google dropping its ban on personally identifiable web tracking.

This took all of about three minutes to put together. Sometimes you have to sweat over ideas for an illustration ... and sometimes they just stroll into your head fully formed.
