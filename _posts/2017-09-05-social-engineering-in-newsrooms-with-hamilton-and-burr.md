# Social engineering in newsrooms with Hamilton and Burr

Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, two of the most successful guys operating during the dawn of American politics, faced a problem very similar to the ones we have in newsrooms today. They wanted to get things done at a breakneck pace, but the politics of dealing with other people slowed them down.

To talk about this, I put together a session at SRCCON in 2019 so conference attendees could explore these topics as a group.

[Hereâ€™s the piece I wrote](https://source.opennews.org/articles/hamilton-and-burr/) after the session. I recapped suggestions for how to approach challenges like being stuck between two managers, having someone quietly kill your idea, accidentally overstepping someone, and more.
